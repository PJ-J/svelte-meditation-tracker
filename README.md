Repo for holding my meditation tracker app. Technologies used include Svelte, Supabase (Postgres Database w/ authentication and row-level security) for user data storage and TailwindCSS for styling.



## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
